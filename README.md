# MudaEdit

## Aim of this Project

If you've been collecting characters on discords Mudae Bot for some while now, you must have realized how tedious it is to order, divorce, select, note, view multiple characters at once.
I want to bring an end to that and make a website, where you can see your whole list and then change every aspect you want of them in an easier way.
This does not mean that once edited on this website your list will change.
You will be prompted the command you'll have to send in your server to do this
